Super Awesome Customer Feedback Program

!! IMPORTANT !! PASSWORD FOR ACCESSING FEEDBACK
Password: ilovefish22

Overview
This is a python based application that allows customers to submit their feedback via a GUI, which is stored in a SQLite database. You can also read all of the submitted feedback, given that you have the password.

What to do in program:
Run it in VSC, input whatever you want into the fields, the program doesn't really care.
Whenever you want to check the feedback, go into the terminal after clicking the button, then enter the password to view all of the data
(IM SORRY IF THE PREEXISTING DATA IS CONFUSING/INSANE)
